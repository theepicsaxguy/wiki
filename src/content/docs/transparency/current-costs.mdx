Running a social network isn't free, but it shouldn't be a mystery either. Here is exactly what we spend to keep **goingdark.social** online.

## The Monthly Bill: ~€30/month

*   **Servers (Hetzner):** ~€20
    *   We run a control node and a worker node on Kubernetes. When traffic spikes, the system automatically spins up extra workers, which costs a bit more.
*   **Storage (Cloudflare R2):** ~$10
    *   This stores all your uploaded images and videos (about 300GB right now). Egress (downloading) is free.
*   **Backups:** ~€5
    *   Snapshots and off-site storage to keep data safe.

## How We Pay For It

We rely entirely on community donations. We don't have investors, and we don't run ads.

If the community grows, costs will go up (more storage, bigger servers). If that happens, we will update this page.

## Want to Help?

If you want to chip in, you can donate via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark). Every coffee helps keep the servers spinning.
