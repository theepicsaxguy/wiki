title: Cloudflare and Privacy
weight: 20

We use **Cloudflare** as a shield for our server. It acts like a bouncer at the door—it protects us from attacks, but it also means Cloudflare handles the traffic before it hits our machine.

## The Trade-Off

**Why we do it:**
*   **DDoS Protection:** Keeps the site online if someone tries to flood us with traffic.
*   **Speed:** Storing images in Cloudflare R2 makes the site load much faster for you.
*   **Cost:** It is significantly cheaper than hosting media directly on our own limited disk space.

**The Privacy Impact:**
Technically, Cloudflare sits in the middle. They process your IP address and web traffic. However, we have configured it to be as private as possible:
*   We **do not** use their intrusive analytics or tracking features.
*   We use their privacy-focused free tier.
*   We trust them because their business model is selling security, not selling user data.

## Direct Messages

Just a reminder: **Mastodon Direct Messages (DMs) are not end-to-end encrypted.**

Think of a DM like a postcard or a private forum message. Admins on the server *can* technically read them (though we don't look without a report), and because the traffic flows through Cloudflare, they technically process that text too.

If you need to send sensitive info (passwords, addresses), please use **Signal** or **Matrix**.
