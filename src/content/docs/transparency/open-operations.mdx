We believe transparency builds trust. Here's how we run things.

## Public Infrastructure Code

All our infrastructure configuration is [public on GitHub](https://github.com/goingdark-social). You can see:
*   How we deploy Mastodon
*   Our Kubernetes configs
*   Backup scripts
*   Monitoring setup

## Decision Making

Major decisions are discussed with the community:
*   **Federation:** We announce server blocks/suspensions publicly (unless doing so would amplify harm).
*   **Policy Changes:** Proposed changes are posted for community feedback before implementation.
*   **Technical Changes:** Major infrastructure changes are documented in GitHub.

## What We Track

We publish:
*   [Monthly costs](/docs/transparency/current-costs/)
*   [Moderation statistics](/docs/policies/moderation-report/) (quarterly)
*   Incident reports when things break

## What We Don't Track

*   Individual user behavior analytics
*   Marketing data
*   Advertising profiles
*   Your reading habits

We only keep logs necessary for security and debugging.
