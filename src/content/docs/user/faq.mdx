## General Questions

### What is Mastodon?
Mastodon is decentralized social media. Instead of one company running everything (like Twitter), thousands of independent servers run the network. You can follow people on other servers, and they can follow you back.

### What makes goingdark.social different?
We focus on privacy, self-hosting, and homelab culture. We are small, community-run, and funded by donations—not ads or investors.

### Do I need a goingdark.social account to follow people here?
Nope! You can follow us from any Mastodon server (or other Fediverse platforms like Pixelfed or PeerTube).

## Account Questions

### Can I change my username?
You can change your display name anytime. Your handle (e.g., `@yourname@goingdark.social`) is permanent once created.

### How do I delete my account?
Go to **Settings → Account → Delete Account**. This is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Can I migrate my account to another server?
Yes! Mastodon has built-in account migration. See our [Migration Guide](/docs/user/migration/).

## Privacy & Safety

### Are Direct Messages (DMs) encrypted?
No. Mastodon DMs are like email—admins can technically read them (though we don't). Use Signal or Matrix for sensitive conversations.

### Can I block entire servers?
Yes. You can personally block (or mute) entire domains from your account settings.

### What happens when I report someone?
Reports go to our moderation team. We review them manually and take action based on our [Rules](/docs/policies/rules/).

## Technical Questions

### Why can't I see some replies?
Federation can be delayed or incomplete. Not every server has every post. This is a feature, not a bug—it prevents centralized control.

### Can I run my own Mastodon server?
Absolutely! We encourage it. Check out the [official Mastodon docs](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/).

### How much does it cost to run this server?
About €30/month. See our [Current Costs](/docs/transparency/current-costs/) page for details.
