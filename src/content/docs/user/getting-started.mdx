Welcome to **goingdark.social**!

If you are coming from Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook, things work a little differently here. We are part of the "Fediverse"—a network of thousands of independent servers that talk to each other.

## 1. Setting Up Your Profile

First impressions matter. Since we don't use algorithms to push content, your profile is how people decide to follow you.

*   **Avatar:** Upload a picture. The default "egg" avatar usually gets ignored.
*   **Bio:** Write a sentence or two. Mention your interests (e.g., `#homelab`, `#privacy`, `#rust`).
*   **Metadata:** You can add up to 4 distinct fields to your profile (like your website, GitHub, or PGP key).

## 2. Your First Post (The #Introduction)

There is a tradition on Mastodon of writing an **#introduction** post.

Tell us who you are, what you are building, and what you are into. Use the hashtag `#introduction` so people can find you. We love boosting these to help newcomers get settled.

## 3. Finding People

Your timeline might look empty at first. That's normal! You have to build it yourself.

*   **Local Timeline:** This shows every public post from people on *our* server. It's the best way to meet your neighbors.
*   **Federated Timeline:** This shows posts from people on *other* servers that our community follows.
*   **Search:** Search for hashtags like `#SelfHosting` or `#Linux` to find your crowd.

## 4. Privacy Settings

Every time you post, you choose who sees it:
*   🌎 **Public:** Visible to everyone, goes to the public timelines.
*   🔓 **Unlisted:** Visible to everyone, but *doesn't* go to public timelines. Good for threads.
*   🔒 **Followers Only:** Only people who follow you can see it.
*   ✉️ **Direct:** Only the people you mention can see it. (Note: This is not end-to-end encrypted like Signal).

## Need Help?

If you get stuck, just ask in the Local Timeline. We are happy to help!
