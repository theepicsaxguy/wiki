**goingdark.social** is a Mastodon instance built for the homelab crowd, privacy enthusiasts, and developers who want to own their digital presence.

We are run by **Going Dark**, a small community group based in the EU. We believe in transparency, which is why all our infrastructure code is [public on GitHub](https://github.com/goingdark-social).

We host on **Hetzner** for performance and reliability. The bills are paid by community donations, keeping us independent and ad-free.
