We wanted a place where people actually build things.

Whether you are configuring your first Pi-hole, managing a full 42U server rack, or writing open-source software, you'll find your peers here. We aren't just talking about privacy and decentralization; we are actively doing it.

### Our Vision
1.  **Digital Independence:** Encouraging people to run their own infrastructure.
2.  **Sustainability:** Staying small, community-funded, and manageable.
3.  **Signal over Noise:** Promoting real conversations over engagement bait.
