## Introduction

These Terms govern your use of **goingdark.social**. The service is operated by an individual administrator in Sweden. We aren't a big corporation, just a community.

By creating an account, you agree to these terms.

## Who Can Use This?

*   **Adults Only:** You must be 18 years or older.
*   **Humans (mostly):** No unapproved bots.

## Acceptable Use

Don't do anything illegal. Don't harass people. Don't try to hack the server.

Specifically, you agree not to:
*   Break Swedish or EU laws.
*   Infringe on copyright.
*   Distribute malware.
*   Scrape data at scale without permission.

## Content and Rights

*   **You own your content.** You keep the copyright.
*   **License:** You give us permission to host, display, and share your content with other Fediverse servers so the service actually works.
*   **Federation:** Be aware that once your content is sent to other servers, we can't forcefully delete it from there.

## Moderation

We use human review and some automated tools (for spam) to enforce rules. We reserve the right to remove content or suspend accounts that violate our policies. You have the right to appeal these decisions.

## Liability

The service is provided "as is." We do our best to keep it running and secure, but we can't guarantee 100% uptime. We aren't liable for lost data—please keep your own backups.

## Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of **Sweden**. We try to resolve disputes amicably within the community first.
