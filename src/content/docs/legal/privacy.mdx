**The Short Version:** We are an EU-based, privacy-first community. We don't track you, we don't sell your data, and we don't use ads. We only keep the data strictly necessary to keep the server running.

## The Details

**Controller:** Administrators of goingdark.social
**Contact:** `legal@goingdark.social`
**Supervisory Authority:** Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten (IMY) - [https://www.imy.se](https://www.imy.se)

### What We Collect

We only collect what Mastodon needs to work:
*   **Account Info:** Username, email, password hash.
*   **Profile:** Whatever you put in your bio, avatar, and header.
*   **Content:** Your posts, polls, boosts, and favorites.
*   **Logs:** IP addresses (kept for 90 days for security) and basic server logs.

### Why We Collect It

We process data to:
1.  **Run the Service:** Let you log in, post, and see other people's posts.
2.  **Safety:** Prevent spam, abuse, and attacks on the server.

### Where is it Stored?

*   **Database & App:** Hosted on servers within the EU (Hetzner).
*   **Media Files:** Images and video are stored in Cloudflare R2 (encrypted at rest).
*   **Backups:** Encrypted and stored securely off-site.

### Federation (Important!)

Mastodon is decentralized. When you post publicly, or message someone on another server, your data is sent to that server. **We cannot delete data from other servers.** Once it leaves our instance, it is out of our direct control.

### Your Rights

Under the GDPR, you have the right to:
*   Access your data (Export in Settings).
*   Correct your data.
*   Delete your data (Delete Account in Settings).
*   Object to processing.

### Children

You must be **18+** to use this service. If we find out a user is a minor, we will delete the account.

### Changes

If we change this policy significantly, we will announce it on the instance. Continued use means you agree to the new terms.
