If a moderator restricts your content or account and you think we got it wrong, you have the right to ask for a review.

## How to Appeal

1.  Go to the warning notification in Mastodon.
2.  Click the **Appeal** button.
3.  Write a brief explanation of why you think the decision was incorrect.

*Note: You can submit one appeal within 20 days of the decision.*

## What Happens Next

*   **Fresh Eyes:** Your appeal is reviewed by moderators or admins who ideally weren't involved in the initial decision.
*   **Fairness:** We aim to be unbiased. If we messed up, we will fix it.
*   **Safety First:** While we review, any restrictions on your account usually remain in place to protect the community.
