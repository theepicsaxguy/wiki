## The Vibe

**goingdark.social** is a gathering place for homelab tinkerers, privacy advocates, and developers. We are here to share knowledge and take back control of our digital lives.

We keep the instance intentionally small. This ensures newcomers get seen, introductions actually lead to conversations, and you don't just feel like a number in a massive database.

These guidelines aren't here to be bureaucratic red tape; they exist to keep this place welcoming and useful.

## What We Don't Want (Disallowed Content)

To keep things running smoothly, the following behaviors will lead to moderation action:

*   **Spam & Scams:** No one wants their timeline filled with ads, crypto-scams, or engagement farming.
*   **Harassment:** Stalking, dog-piling, or being generally aggressive towards others is out.
*   **Hate & Discrimination:** We have zero tolerance for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or religious bigotry.
*   **Dangerous Misinformation:** Don't spread false claims that could hurt people's health or safety.
*   **Illegal Content:** Anything prohibited by EU or Swedish law (like CSAM or extremist material) is banned.
*   **Unapproved Bots:** Automation is cool, but ask first. See the [Bot Policy](/docs/policies/bots-and-automation/).
*   **Disruptive Behavior:** Don't flood the timeline or try to break the server.

## Adult Content (NSFW)

We are adults here, so adult themes, art, and body positivity are welcome, but:

1.  **Always** use a Content Warning (CW).
2.  **Consent is mandatory.**
3.  **No minors.** Ever.
4.  **Balance:** If your account is *only* explicit sexual content, this probably isn't the right instance for you. We will kindly ask you to migrate to a server dedicated to that content.

## How Moderation Works

We are here to protect the community, not police thoughts. Our actions depend on the severity:

*   **Warning:** A friendly DM explaining what went wrong.
*   **Limiting:** Your posts might be hidden from the public timeline.
*   **Suspension:** A temporary or permanent break from the server.
*   **Removal:** Deleting specific harmful posts.

If you see something, say something. Use the **Report** button.

## Language

*   **European languages** are welcome. English and Swedish are the most common here.
*   If we can't understand it, we might have a harder time moderating it, but we try our best.

## How to Participate

This isn't just a server; it's a community.

*   **Boost Introductions:** Help new people find friends.
*   **Share Knowledge:** Post about your server rack, your code, or your privacy setup.
*   **No Gatekeeping:** Beginners are welcome. We were all n00bs once.
*   **Volunteer:** If you want to help translate, moderate, or code, just ask!
