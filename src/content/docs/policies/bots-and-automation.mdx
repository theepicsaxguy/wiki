## People First

Going Dark is for humans. Timelines should be full of real conversations, not automated RSS feeds or algorithmic noise.

**The Rule:** You cannot create a bot without prior approval. Unapproved bots are suspended immediately.

## When We Approve Bots

We make rare exceptions for bots that:
1.  Actually add value to the community (e.g., specific privacy news, open-source updates).
2.  **Stay out of the timeline** (post as Unlisted).
3.  Are explicitly labeled as bots.

## Requirements

If you want to run a bot:
*   **Label it:** The bio must say it's a bot and link to your main human account.
*   **Set it to Unlisted:** Unless you have special permission, bots should not clutter the Local Timeline.
*   **Monitor it:** You are responsible for what your bot posts.

## How to Apply

Send a DM to the administrator account (`@fanfare`) with your proposal. Tell us what the bot does and why the community needs it.
