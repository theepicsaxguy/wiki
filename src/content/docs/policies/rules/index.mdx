> **The Spirit of the Law:** These rules exist to keep the community healthy. We moderate based on the *intent* and *impact* of behavior, not just technicalities.

## The Rules List

1.  **[Treat people well](01_treat-people-well/)**
    Don't be a jerk. Disagree without being hostile.
2.  **[Use Content Warnings](02_content-warnings/)**
    Label sensitive, spoiler-heavy, or shocking content.
3.  **[Keep it clean](03_keep-it-clean/)**
    No gratuitous gore or violence. NSFW is allowed *only* with a tag.
4.  **[No illegal content](04_no-illegal-content/)**
    If it's illegal in the EU/Sweden, it's not allowed here.
5.  **[No spam](05_no-spam/)**
    We are here for conversation, not your billboard.

    Zero tolerance for bigotry, racism, or threats of violence.
7.  **[Don't look for loopholes](07_no-loopholes/)**
    Trying to "game" the rules is a violation of the rules.
8.  **[Consequences](08_consequences/)**
    We warn, limit, or suspend based on severity.
9.  **[Be honest about identity](09_honest-identity/)**
    Parody is fine if labeled; impersonation is not.

    Don't DDoS us, scrap us, or try to break the tech.
11. **[No Doxing](11_no-doxing/)**
    Respect privacy. Don't post other people's personal info.
12. **[Stop means stop](12_stop-means-stop/)**
    If someone blocks you or asks you to leave them alone, do it.
13. **[No unapproved bots](13_bots/)**
    Read the [Bot Policy](/docs/policies/bots-and-automation/).
14. **[No calls for violence](14_no-calls-for-violence/)**
    Advocating for harm gets you banned immediately.
