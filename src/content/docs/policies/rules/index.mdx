> **The Spirit of the Law:** These rules exist to keep the community healthy. We moderate based on the *intent* and *impact* of behavior, not just technicalities.

<RuleGrid>
  <RuleCard title="Treat People Well" iconName="shield" severity="high" number={1} client:load>
    **The Golden Rule applies.** Speak to others the way you'd like them to speak to you.

    Because we keep this community intentionally small, tone matters. It shapes the vibe for everyone.
    
    * Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
    * Avoid personal insults, baiting, or "dog-piling."
    * If a conversation turns toxic, disengage and use the Report tool.

    We aren't asking for toxic positivity—you can disagree—but we are asking for basic professional respect.
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="Use Content Warnings" iconName="alert" severity="medium" number={2} client:load>
    **Label sensitive content appropriately.** Content Warnings (CW) help people decide what they want to see.

    Use CWs for:
    
    * **Spoilers** for movies, shows, books, or games
    * **Politics** or controversial current events
    * **Mental health** topics (depression, suicide, etc.)
    * **Violence, gore, or disturbing imagery**
    * **Food** (some users have eating disorders)
    * **Flashing lights or eye strain** (accessibility)

    If you're not sure whether something needs a CW, it probably does. Better safe than sorry.
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="No Spam" iconName="ban" severity="medium" number={3} client:load>
    **We are here for conversation, not advertising.** Spam ruins communities.

    What counts as spam:
    
    * Posting the same content repeatedly
    * Unsolicited advertisements or promotions
    * Link farming or SEO schemes
    * Mass-following people just to get followers back
    * Automated posting without disclosure

    Sharing interesting links or your own work occasionally is fine. Just don't be pushy about it.
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="No Hate or Threats" iconName="shield-alert" severity="high" number={4} client:load>
    **Zero tolerance for bigotry or violence.** This is non-negotiable.

    Prohibited content includes:
    
    * Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other bigotry
    * Hate speech or slurs
    * Threats of violence against individuals or groups
    * Encouraging self-harm or suicide
    * Holocaust denial or genocide justification

    This includes "just joking" or "ironic" hate. We don't care about your intent—if it harms people, it's not allowed.

    **Violations result in immediate suspension.**
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="Keep it Clean" iconName="sparkles" severity="medium" number={5} client:load>
    **No gratuitous gore or violence.** NSFW content is allowed *only* with proper content warnings and tags.

    * Use content warnings and mark posts as sensitive
    * No shock content or extreme violence
    * Adult content must be clearly labeled
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="No Illegal Content" iconName="scale" severity="high" number={6} client:load>
    **If it's illegal in the EU/Sweden, it's not allowed here.** This includes:

    * Piracy links or copyrighted material
    * Child exploitation of any kind
    * Malware or phishing attempts
    * Illegal drugs or weapons sales
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="Don't Look for Loopholes" iconName="search-x" severity="medium" number={7} client:load>
    **Trying to "game" the rules is a violation of the rules.** We moderate based on intent and impact, not technicalities.

    If you find yourself thinking "technically this isn't against the rules," you're probably about to break them.
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="Consequences" iconName="zap" severity="low" number={8} client:load>
    **We warn, limit, or suspend based on severity.** Our moderation approach:

    1. **First offense (minor):** Warning with explanation
    2. **Repeat offense:** Temporary silence or limited reach
    3. **Severe violation:** Immediate suspension
    4. **Egregious content:** Permanent ban

    We believe in second chances for honest mistakes, but not for bad faith actors.
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="Be Honest About Identity" iconName="user-check" severity="medium" number={9} client:load>
    **Parody is fine if labeled; impersonation is not.**

    * Parody accounts must clearly indicate they're parody
    * Don't impersonate real people, organizations, or brands
    * Satire should be obvious
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="Respect the Server" iconName="server" severity="high" number={10} client:load>
    **Don't attack our infrastructure.**

    * No DDoS attacks or attempts
    * No unauthorized scraping or data harvesting
    * No attempts to exploit vulnerabilities
    * No excessive API usage

    Security researchers: please report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="No Doxing" iconName="lock" severity="high" number={11} client:load>
    **Respect privacy.** Don't post other people's personal information.

    This includes:
    
    * Home addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses
    * Financial information
    * Private messages without consent
    * "Public" information compiled to harass someone
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="Stop Means Stop" iconName="hand" severity="high" number={12} client:load>
    **If someone blocks you or asks you to leave them alone, do it.**

    * Don't create alt accounts to evade blocks
    * Don't contact them on other platforms
    * Don't send your friends to message them
    * Don't subpost about them constantly

    Take the hint and move on.
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="No Unapproved Bots" iconName="bot" severity="medium" number={13} client:load>
    **All bots must be approved before joining.**

    Read our [Bot Policy](/docs/policies/bots-and-automation/) for the application process.

    * Bots must be clearly marked as bots
    * Bots must have a clear purpose
    * Bots must not spam or annoy users
  </RuleCard>

  <RuleCard title="No Calls for Violence" iconName="alert-octagon" severity="high" number={14} client:load>
    **Advocating for harm gets you banned immediately.**

    * No inciting violence against people or groups
    * No organizing harassment campaigns
    * No encouraging dangerous or illegal activities

    This rule has zero tolerance. First violation = permanent ban.
  </RuleCard>
