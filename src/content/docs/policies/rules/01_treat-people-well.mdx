**The Golden Rule applies.** Speak to others the way you'd like them to speak to you.

Because we keep this community intentionally small, tone matters. It shapes the vibe for everyone.
*   Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
*   Avoid personal insults, baiting, or "dog-piling."
*   If a conversation turns toxic, disengage and use the Report tool.

We aren't asking for toxic positivity—you can disagree—but we are asking for basic professional respect.
