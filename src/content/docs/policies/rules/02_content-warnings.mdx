title: Rule 2 - Use Content Warnings
weight: 2

**Label sensitive content appropriately.** Content Warnings (CW) help people decide what they want to see.

Use CWs for:
*   **Spoilers** for movies, shows, books, or games
*   **Politics** or controversial current events
*   **Mental health** topics (depression, suicide, etc.)
*   **Violence, gore, or disturbing imagery**
*   **Food** (some users have eating disorders)
*   **Flashing lights or eye strain** (accessibility)

If you're not sure whether something needs a CW, it probably does. Better safe than sorry.
