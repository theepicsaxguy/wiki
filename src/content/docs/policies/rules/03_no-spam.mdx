title: Rule 3 - No Spam
weight: 3

**We are here for conversation, not advertising.** Spam ruins communities.

What counts as spam:
*   Posting the same content repeatedly
*   Unsolicited advertisements or promotions
*   Link farming or SEO schemes
*   Mass-following people just to get followers back
*   Automated posting without disclosure

Sharing interesting links or your own work occasionally is fine. Just don't be pushy about it.
