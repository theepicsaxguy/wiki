**Zero tolerance for bigotry or violence.** This is non-negotiable.

Prohibited content includes:
*   Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other bigotry
*   Hate speech or slurs
*   Threats of violence against individuals or groups
*   Encouraging self-harm or suicide

This includes "just joking" or "ironic" hate. We don't care about your intent—if it harms people, it's not allowed.

**Violations result in immediate suspension.**
