Things break. When they do, here's how we handle it.

## Monitoring

We use:
*   **Uptime monitoring:** External service checks every 60 seconds.
*   **Log aggregation:** Centralized logging for debugging.
*   **Alerts:** Admins get notified via email and push notifications.

## Incident Levels

### Level 1: Minor (Degraded Performance)
*   Some users experience slowness.
*   Non-critical features are impacted.
*   **Response:** Investigate within 4 hours.

### Level 2: Major (Service Disruption)
*   Many users cannot access the service.
*   Core features are broken.
*   **Response:** Investigate immediately. Post status update within 30 minutes.

### Level 3: Critical (Complete Outage)
*   The service is completely down.
*   **Response:** All hands on deck. Status updates every 15 minutes.

## Status Updates

During incidents, we post updates on:
*   The Mastodon instance (if accessible)
*   [GitHub Status Page](https://github.com/goingdark-social/status)
*   Community Matrix channel

## Post-Incident Reports

After major incidents, we publish a public report including:
*   What happened
*   Why it happened
*   What we're doing to prevent it from happening again
