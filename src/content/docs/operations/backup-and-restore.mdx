We take backups seriously. Your data is too valuable to lose.

## What We Backup

*   **PostgreSQL Database:** Full daily backups + incremental every 6 hours.
*   **Media Files:** Snapshots of Cloudflare R2 storage weekly.
*   **Configuration:** All Kubernetes configs are versioned in Git.

## Where Backups Are Stored

*   **Primary:** Hetzner Storage Boxes (encrypted at rest).
*   **Off-site:** Encrypted backups replicated to a separate data center.

## Retention Policy

*   **Daily backups:** Kept for 7 days.
*   **Weekly backups:** Kept for 30 days.
*   **Monthly backups:** Kept for 1 year.

## Recovery Time

In the event of a disaster:
*   **Database restore:** ~15 minutes (automated).
*   **Full system restore:** ~2 hours (manual intervention required).

We test our backups quarterly to ensure they actually work.
