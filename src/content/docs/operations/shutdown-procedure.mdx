title: Shutdown Procedure
weight: 50
---

We plan to keep **goingdark.social** running indefinitely. But if circumstances change, here's our promise to you.

## If We Ever Have to Shut Down

We will give you **at least 90 days notice** before shutting down the server.

During that time:
1.  **Account Migration:** We will help you move your account to another server.
2.  **Data Export:** You can download all your posts, media, and followers.
3.  **Archive Availability:** We will keep read-only archives available for 6 months after shutdown (if technically feasible).

## Successor Planning

If the current admin can no longer maintain the server, we will:
*   Seek a trusted community member to take over.
*   Provide full access to infrastructure and documentation.
*   Ensure a smooth transition with zero downtime.

## Data Deletion

After the server shuts down:
*   All user data will be securely deleted from our servers.
*   Backups will be destroyed after 6 months.
*   We will never sell or transfer user data to a third party.

## Why This Matters

Unlike corporate social media, you deserve to know what happens to your data if we close. We're committed to doing this right.
