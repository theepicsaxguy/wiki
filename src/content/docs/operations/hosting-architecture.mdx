**goingdark.social** runs on **Talos Linux** and **Kubernetes**. We treat our infrastructure as code.

### The Stack

*   **Cloud Provider:** Hetzner Cloud (EU / Germany).
*   **Storage:**
    *   Media: Cloudflare R2 (Public bucket for access, private for backups).
    *   Database: Local NVMe storage with automated snapshots.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL with PgBouncer for connection pooling.
*   **Caching:** Redis.
*   **Search:** Elasticsearch.

### Security

*   Public endpoints (Web/API) are proxied via Cloudflare Tunnel.
*   Internal services run on a private network and are not exposed to the internet.
*   All code configurations are audit-logged and versioned on GitHub.
