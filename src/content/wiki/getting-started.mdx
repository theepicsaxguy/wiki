# Getting Started

Welcome to goingdark.social! This guide will help you get started on our Mastodon instance.

## What is Mastodon?

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network. Unlike centralized platforms, Mastodon is **decentralized** - it consists of many independent servers (instances) that communicate with each other.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized** - No single company owns the network
- **Open Source** - Code is publicly available and auditable
- **No Ads** - Your timeline isn't cluttered with advertisements
- **Chronological Timeline** - No algorithmic manipulation
- **500 Character Limit** - More room to express yourself
- **Content Warnings** - Hide sensitive content behind warnings

## Creating Your Account

1. Visit [goingdark.social](https://goingdark.social)
2. Click "Create account"
3. Choose a username and strong password
4. Enter your email address
5. Read and accept our [server rules](/wiki/rules)
6. Verify your email

<Callout type="tip" title="Username Tips">
Your username will be **@username@goingdark.social**. Choose something you'll be happy with long-term, as changing it later can be confusing for followers.

## Setting Up Your Profile

After creating your account:

1. **Upload an Avatar** - Click your profile and choose "Edit profile"
2. **Add a Header Image** - Make your profile visually appealing

   - **Public** - Visible to everyone
   - **Unlisted** - Not shown in public timelines
   - **Followers** - Only your followers see it
   - **Direct** - Only mentioned users see it

<Callout type="info" title="Content Warnings">
Use content warnings (CW) for potentially sensitive topics like politics, food, mental health, or spoilers. It's a courtesy that helps others control what they see.

## Understanding Timelines

Mastodon has three main timelines:

- **Home** - Posts from people you follow
- **Local** - Public posts from goingdark.social users
- **Federated** - Public posts from across the Fediverse

## Finding People to Follow

- Browse the **Local** and **Federated** timelines
- Check who your follows are following
- Use hashtags to find people with similar interests
- Look at the **Explore** page for trending posts

## Mastodon Etiquette

- Use content warnings appropriately
- Add alt text to images for accessibility
- Use hashtags (they're the only way to make posts discoverable)
- Be respectful and follow our [server rules](/wiki/rules)
- Don't engage with harassers - report and block them
