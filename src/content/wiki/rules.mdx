## Core Rules

### 1. Be Respectful

Treat others with dignity and respect. We're all here to connect and share ideas.

- No harassment, bullying, or personal attacks
- Respect people's identities, pronouns, and boundaries

### 4. Content Warnings & NSFW

Help others curate their experience with proper content warnings.

### 6. Privacy and Consent

- Don't screenshot and share private posts without consent
- Respect "followers only" and unlisted post visibility

### 7. No Misinformation

Especially regarding health, safety, and current events.

- Don't spread deliberate misinformation
- Fact-check before sharing, especially news
- Note when something is speculation or opinion

### 8. Alt Text for Images

Make content accessible to everyone.

- Add descriptive alt text to images when possible
- This helps visually impaired users and improves the community for everyone

## Moderation Guidelines

### We Will Act On

- Reports from community members
- Content that violates server rules
- Patterns of problematic behavior
- Federation issues with other instances

### Moderator Actions

1. **Warning**: First offense for minor violations
2. **Temporary Silence**: Limited reach for repeated issues
3. **Temporary Suspension**: Time-limited account suspension
4. **Permanent Ban**: Severe or repeated violations

### Appeals

If you believe a moderation action was taken in error:

1. Email admin@goingdark.social
2. Include your username and the action taken
3. Explain your perspective calmly
4. Wait for a response (usually within 48 hours)

## Federation Policy

### We Defederate From

- Instances that allow illegal content
- Instances with poor or no moderation
- Instances promoting hate speech
- Instances that enable harassment campaigns

### Limited Federation

Some instances may be limited (silenced) rather than fully blocked, meaning:
- Their content doesn't appear in public timelines
- You can still follow users from these instances if you choose

## Reporting

If you see content that violates these rules:

1. Use the **Report** function in Mastodon
2. Select which rule(s) are being violated
3. Add any relevant context
4. Our moderation team will review within 24 hours

<Callout type="info">
  When in doubt, report it. False positives are fine; we'd rather investigate than miss something important.
</Callout>

## Additional Guidelines

### Bots and Automation

- Bot accounts must be marked as bots
- Must not spam or excessively post
- Must follow all other server rules
- Approval required for high-frequency posting

### Commercial Use

- Light self-promotion is okay
- Excessive advertising is not
- No cryptocurrency promotion or NFT shilling
- Affiliate links should be disclosed

### Account Squatting

- Don't register accounts you won't use
- Don't impersonate others
- Parody accounts must be clearly marked

## Philosophy

Our rules exist to create a space where people can express themselves freely while respecting others. We believe in:

- **Privacy over profit** - Your data is yours
- **Safety over growth** - We'd rather be small and safe than large and toxic
- **Community over algorithms** - People matter more than engagement metrics

## Updates

These rules may be updated as needed. Major changes will be announced to all users.

**Last Updated**: November 2024
