## Data Sharing and Federation

### The Fediverse

Mastodon is a federated network. This means:

- **Unlisted posts** don't appear in public timelines but are still publicly accessible
- **Followers-only posts** are shared only with your followers' instances
- **Direct messages** are sent to recipient instances (not end-to-end encrypted)

<Callout type="warning">
  Direct messages on Mastodon are **not end-to-end encrypted**. Instance admins can technically access them. Don't share highly sensitive information via DMs.
