We are here to share knowledge and take back control of our digital lives.\n\nWe keep the instance intentionally small.

See the [Bot Policy](/docs/policies/bots-and-automation/).\n*   **Disruptive Behavior:** Don't flood the timeline or try to break the server.\n\n## Adult Content (NSFW)\n\nWe are adults here, so adult themes, art, and body positivity are welcome, but:\n\n1.  **Always** use a Content Warning (CW).\n2.  **Consent is mandatory.**\n3.  **No minors.** Ever.\n4.  **Balance:** If your account is *only* explicit sexual content, this probably isn't the right instance for you. We will kindly ask you to migrate to a server dedicated to that content.\n\n---\n\n## How Moderation Works\n\nWe are here to protect the community, not police thoughts. Our actions depend on the severity:\n\n*   **Warning:** A friendly DM explaining what went wrong.\n*   **Limiting:** Your posts might be hidden from the public timeline.\n*   **Suspension:** A temporary or permanent break from the server.\n*   **Removal:** Deleting specific harmful posts.\n\nIf you see something, say something. Use the **Report** button.\n\n---\n\n## Language\n\n*   **European languages** are welcome. English and Swedish are the most common here.\n*   If we can't understand it, we might have a harder time moderating it, but we try our best.\n\n---\n\n## How to Participate\n\nThis isn't just a server; it's a community.\n\n*   **Boost Introductions:** Help new people find friends.\n*   **Share Knowledge:** Post about your server rack, your code, or your privacy setup.\n*   **No Gatekeeping:** Beginners are welcome.

We are part of the \"Fediverse\"—a network of thousands of independent servers that talk to each other.\n\n## 1. Setting Up Your Profile\n\nFirst impressions matter. Since we don't use algorithms to push content, your profile is how people decide to follow you.\n\n*   **Avatar:** Upload a picture. The default \"egg\" avatar usually gets ignored.\n*   **Bio:** Write a sentence or two. Mention your interests (e.g., `#homelab`, `#privacy`, `#rust`).\n*   **Metadata:** You can add up to 4 distinct fields to your profile (like your website, GitHub, or PGP key).\n\n## 2. Your First Post (The #Introduction)\n\nThere is a tradition on Mastodon of writing an **#introduction** post.\n\nTell us who you are, what you are building, and what you are into. Use the hashtag `#introduction` so people can find you. We love boosting these to help newcomers get settled.\n\n## 3. Finding People\n\nYour timeline might look empty at first. That's normal! You have to build it yourself.\n\n*   **Local Timeline:** This shows every public post from people on *our* server. It's the best way to meet your neighbors.\n*   **Federated Timeline:** This shows posts from people on *other* servers that our community follows.\n*   **Search:** Search for hashtags like `#SelfHosting` or `#Linux` to find your crowd.\n\n## 4. Privacy Settings\n\nEvery time you post, you choose who sees it:\n*   🌎 **Public:** Visible to everyone, goes to the public timelines.\n*   🔓 **Unlisted:** Visible to everyone, but *doesn't* go to public timelines. Good for threads.\n*   🔒 **Followers Only:** Only people who follow you can see it.\n*   ✉️ **Direct:** Only the people you mention can see it.

Instead of one company running everything (like Twitter), thousands of independent servers run the network. You can follow people on other servers, and they can follow you back.\n\n### What makes goingdark.social different?\nWe focus on privacy, self-hosting, and homelab culture. We are small, community-run, and funded by donations—not ads or investors.\n\n### Do I need a goingdark.social account to follow people here?\nNope! You can follow us from any Mastodon server (or other Fediverse platforms like Pixelfed or PeerTube).\n\n## Account Questions\n\n### Can I change my username?\nYou can change your display name anytime. Your handle (e.g., `@yourname@goingdark.social`) is permanent once created.\n\n### How do I delete my account?\nGo to **Settings → Account → Delete Account**. This is permanent and cannot be undone.\n\n### Can I migrate my account to another server?\nYes! Mastodon has built-in account migration. See our [Migration Guide](/docs/user/migration/).\n\n## Privacy & Safety\n\n### Are Direct Messages (DMs) encrypted?\nNo. Mastodon DMs are like email—admins can technically read them (though we don't). Use Signal or Matrix for sensitive conversations.\n\n### Can I block entire servers?\nYes. You can personally block (or mute) entire domains from your account settings.\n\n### What happens when I report someone?\nReports go to our moderation team. We review them manually and take action based on our [Rules](/docs/policies/rules/).\n\n## Technical Questions\n\n### Why can't I see some replies?\nFederation can be delayed or incomplete. Not every server has every post. This is a feature, not a bug—it prevents centralized control.\n\n### Can I run my own Mastodon server?\nAbsolutely! We encourage it. Check out the [official Mastodon docs](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/).\n\n### How much does it cost to run this server?\nAbout €30/month.

Don't harass people. Don't try to hack the server.\n\nSpecifically, you agree not to:\n*   Break Swedish or EU laws.\n*   Infringe on copyright.\n*   Distribute malware.\n*   Scrape data at scale without permission.\n\n## Content and Rights\n\n*   **You own your content.** You keep the copyright.\n*   **License:** You give us permission to host, display, and share your content with other Fediverse servers so the service actually works.\n*   **Federation:** Be aware that once your content is sent to other servers, we can't forcefully delete it from there.\n\n## Moderation\n\nWe use human review and some automated tools (for spam) to enforce rules. We reserve the right to remove content or suspend accounts that violate our policies. You have the right to appeal these decisions.\n\n## Liability\n\nThe service is provided \"as is.\" We do our best to keep it running and secure, but we can't guarantee 100% uptime.

Here is exactly what we spend to keep **goingdark.social** online.\n\n## The Monthly Bill: ~€30/month\n\n*   **Servers (Hetzner):** ~€20\n    *   We run a control node and a worker node on Kubernetes. When traffic spikes, the system automatically spins up extra workers, which costs a bit more.\n*   **Storage (Cloudflare R2):** ~$10\n    *   This stores all your uploaded images and videos (about 300GB right now). Egress (downloading) is free.\n*   **Backups:** ~€5\n    *   Snapshots and off-site storage to keep data safe.\n\n## How We Pay For It\n\nWe rely entirely on community donations. We don't have investors, and we don't run ads.\n\nIf the community grows, costs will go up (more storage, bigger servers). If that happens, we will update this page.\n\n## Want to Help?\n\nIf you want to chip in, you can donate via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark).

It acts like a bouncer at the door—it protects us from attacks, but it also means Cloudflare handles the traffic before it hits our machine.\n\n## The Trade-Off\n\n**Why we do it:**\n*   **DDoS Protection:** Keeps the site online if someone tries to flood us with traffic.\n*   **Speed:** Storing images in Cloudflare R2 makes the site load much faster for you.\n*   **Cost:** It is significantly cheaper than hosting media directly on our own limited disk space.\n\n**The Privacy Impact:**\nTechnically, Cloudflare sits in the middle. They process your IP address and web traffic. However, we have configured it to be as private as possible:\n*   We **do not** use their intrusive analytics or tracking features.\n*   We use their privacy-focused free tier.\n*   We trust them because their business model is selling security, not selling user data.\n\n## Direct Messages\n\nJust a reminder: **Mastodon Direct Messages (DMs) are not end-to-end encrypted.**\n\nThink of a DM like a postcard or a private forum message. Admins on the server *can* technically read them (though we don't look without a report), and because the traffic flows through Cloudflare, they technically process that text too.\n\nIf you need to send sensitive info (passwords, addresses), please use **Signal** or **Matrix**.","src/content/docs/transparency/cloudflare-and-privacy.mdx","060a2476aad5c5d7","transparency/cloudflare-and-privacy.mdx","transparency/open-operations",{"id":199,"data":201,"body":203,"filePath":204,"digest":205,"legacyId":206,"deferredRender":21},{"title":202,"weight":16},"Open Operations","We believe transparency builds trust.
