This guide will help you get started on our Mastodon instance.\n\n## What is Mastodon?\n\nMastodon is a free, open-source social network. Unlike centralized platforms, Mastodon is **decentralized** - it consists of many independent servers (instances) that communicate with each other.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Decentralized** - No single company owns the network\n- **Open Source** - Code is publicly available and auditable\n- **No Ads** - Your timeline isn't cluttered with advertisements\n- **Chronological Timeline** - No algorithmic manipulation\n- **500 Character Limit** - More room to express yourself\n- **Content Warnings** - Hide sensitive content behind warnings\n\n## Creating Your Account\n\n1. Visit [goingdark.social](https://goingdark.social)\n2. Click \"Create account\"\n3. Choose a username and strong password\n4. Enter your email address\n5. Read and accept our [server rules](/wiki/rules)\n6. Verify your email\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"tip\" title=\"Username Tips\">\nYour username will be **@username@goingdark.social**. Choose something you'll be happy with long-term, as changing it later can be confusing for followers.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## Setting Up Your Profile\n\nAfter creating your account:\n\n1. **Upload an Avatar** - Click your profile and choose \"Edit profile\"\n2. **Add a Header Image** - Make your profile visually appealing\n3. **Write a Bio** - Tell people about yourself (500 characters)\n4. **Add Metadata** - Include links, pronouns, or other info\n\n## Your First Post\n\nReady to post?

Choose visibility:\n   - **Public** - Visible to everyone\n   - **Unlisted** - Not shown in public timelines\n   - **Followers** - Only your followers see it\n   - **Direct** - Only mentioned users see it\n4. Click \"Post\"\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"info\" title=\"Content Warnings\">\nUse content warnings (CW) for potentially sensitive topics like politics, food, mental health, or spoilers. It's a courtesy that helps others control what they see.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## Understanding Timelines\n\nMastodon has three main timelines:\n\n- **Home** - Posts from people you follow\n- **Local** - Public posts from goingdark.social users\n- **Federated** - Public posts from across the Fediverse\n\n## Finding People to Follow\n\n- Browse the **Local** and **Federated** timelines\n- Check who your follows are following\n- Use hashtags to find people with similar interests\n- Look at the **Explore** page for trending posts\n\n## Mastodon Etiquette\n\n- Use content warnings appropriately\n- Add alt text to images for accessibility\n- Use hashtags (they're the only way to make posts discoverable)\n- Be respectful and follow our [server rules](/wiki/rules)\n- Don't engage with harassers - report and block them\n\n## Mobile Apps\n\nMastodon has excellent mobile apps:\n\n- **Official Mastodon App** (iOS & Android)\n- **Tusky** (Android)\n- **Toot!** (iOS)\n- **Moshidon** (Android)\n- **Ice Cubes** (iOS)\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you have questions:\n\n1.
